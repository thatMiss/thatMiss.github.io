								<p>
									The cyber kill chain is an adaptation of the military’s kill chain, which is a
									step-by-step approach
									that identifies and stops enemy activity. Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in
									2011, the cyber
									kill chain outlines the various stages of several common cyberattacks and, by
									extension, the points
									at which the information security team can prevent, detect or intercept attackers.
									<br><br>The cyber kill chain is intended to defend against sophisticated
									cyberattacks, also
									known as
									advanced persistent threats (APTs), wherein adversaries spend significant time
									surveilling and
									planning an attack. Most commonly these attacks involve a combination of malware,
									ransomware,
									Trojans, spoofing and social engineering techniques to carry out their plan.

								<p><b>8 Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain Process:</b></p><br>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p>Lockheed Martin’s original cyber kill chain model contained seven sequential steps:
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Phase 1: Reconnaissance</b><br>
									During the Reconnaissance phase, a malicious actor identifies a target and
									explores
									vulnerabilities
									and weaknesses that can be exploited within the network. As part of this
									process,
									the
									attacker may
									harvest login credentials or gather other information, such as email addresses,
									user
									IDs, physical
									locations, software applications and operating system details, all of which may
									be
									useful in
									phishing or spoofing attacks. Generally speaking, the more information the
									attacker
									is
									able to
									gather during the Reconnaissance phase, the more sophisticated and convincing
									the
									attack
									will be
									and, hence, the higher the likelihood of success.</p><br>

								<p><b>Phase 2: Weaponization</b><br>
									During the Weaponization phase, the attacker creates an attack vector, such as
									remote
									access
									malware, ransomware, virus or worm that can exploit a known vulnerability.
									During
									this
									phase, the
									attacker may also set up back doors so that they can continue to access to the
									system if
									their
									original point of entry is identified and closed by network administrators.</p>
								<br>

								<p><b>Phase 3: Delivery</b><br>
									In the Delivery step, the intruder launches the attack. The specific steps taken
									will
									depend on the
									type of attack they intend to carry out. For example, the attacker may send
									email
									attachments or a
									malicious link to spur user activity to advance the plan. This activity may be
									combined
									with social
									engineering techniques to increase the effectiveness of the campaign.</p>
								<br>

								<p><b>Phase 4: Exploitation</b><br>
									In the Exploitation phase, the malicious code is executed within the victim’s
									system.
								</p>
								<br>

								<p><b>Phase 5: Installation</b><br>
									Immediately following the Exploitation phase, the malware or other attack vector
									will
									be
									installed
									on the victim’s system. This is a turning point in the attack lifecycle, as the
									threat
									actor has
									entered the system and can now assume control</p>.
								<br>

								<p><b>Phase 6: Command and Control</b> <br>
									In Command & Control, the attacker is able to
									use the malware to assume remote control
									of a device
									or identity within the target network. In this stage, the attacker may also work
									to
									move
									laterally
									throughout the network, expanding their access and establishing more points of
									entry
									for
									the future.</p><br>

								<p><b>Phase 7: Actions on Objective</b><br>
									In this stage, the attacker takes steps to carry out their intended goals, which
									may
									include data
									theft, destruction, encryption or exfiltration.
									<br><br>Over time, many information security experts have expanded the kill
									chain to include
									an
									eighth step:
									Monetization. In this phase, the cybercriminal focuses on deriving income from
									the
									attack, be it
									through some form of ransom to be paid by the victim or selling sensitive
									information,
									such as
									personal data or trade secrets, on the dark web.
									<br><br>Generally speaking, the earlier the organization can stop the threat
									within the
									cyber
									attack
									lifecycle, the less risk the organization will assume. Attacks that reach the
									Command
									and Control
									phase typically require far more advanced remediation efforts, including
									in-depth
									sweeps
									of the
									network and endpoints to determine the scale and depth of the attack. As such,
									organizations should
									take steps to identify and neutralize threats as early in the lifecycle as
									possible
									in
									order to
									minimize both the risk of an attack and the cost of resolving an event.

								<p><b>Evolution of the Cyber Kill Chain</b></p><br>
								<p>As noted above, the cyber kill chain continues to evolve as attackers change their
									techniques. Since
									the release of the cyber kill chain model in 2011, cybercriminals have become far
									more sophisticated
									in their techniques and more brazen in their activity.
									<br>While still a helpful tool, the cyberattack lifecycle is far less predictable
									and
									clear cut today
									than it was a decade ago. For example, it is not uncommon for cyber attackers to
									skip or combine
									steps, particularly in the first half of the lifecycle. This gives organizations
									less time and
									opportunity to discover and neutralize threats early in the lifecycle. In addition,
									the prevalence
									of the kill chain model may give cyberattackers some indication of how organizations
									are structuring
									their defense, which could inadvertently help them avoid detection at key points
									within the attack
									lifecycle.

								<p><b>Critiques and Concerns Related to the Cyber Kill Chain</b></p><br>
								<p>While the cyber kill chain is a popular and common framework from which organizations
									can begin to
									develop a cybersecurity strategy, it contains several important and potentially
									devastating flaws.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Perimeter Security</b></p><br>
								<p>One of the most common critiques of the cyber kill chain model is that is focuses on
									perimeter
									security and malware prevention. This is an especially pressing concern as
									organizations shift away
									from tradition on-prem networks in favor of the cloud.
									<br>Likewise, an acceleration of the remote work trend and a proliferation of
									personal
									devices, IoT
									technology and even advanced applications like robotic process automation (RPA) has
									exponentially
									increased the attack surface for many enterprise organizations. This means that
									cybercriminals have
									far more points of access to exploit—and companies will have a more difficult time
									securing each and
									every endpoint.
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Attack Vulnerabilities</b></p><br>
								<p>Another potential shortcoming of the kill chain is that it is limited in terms of the
									types of
									attacks that can be detected. For example, the original framework is not able to
									detect insider
									threats, which is among the most serious risks to an organization and one of the
									attack types that
									has the highest rates of success. Attacks that leverage compromised credentials by
									unauthorized
									parties also cannot be detected within the original kill chain framework.
									<br>Web-based attacks may also go undetected by the cyber kill chain framework.
									Examples
									of such attacks
									include Cross Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, DoS/DDoS and some Zero Day
									Exploits. The massive
									2017 Equifax breach, which occurred in part because of a compromised software patch,
									is a
									high-profile example of a web attack that went undetected due to insufficient
									security.
									<br>Finally, while the framework is intended to detect sophisticated, highly
									researched
									attacks, the
									cyber kill chain often misses those attackers who do not conduct significant
									reconnaissance. For
									example, those who use a “spray and pray” technique often avoid carefully laid
									detection snares by
									pure happenstance.

								<p><b>Role of the Cyber Kill Chain in Cybersecurity</b></p><br>
								<p>Despite some shortcomings, the Cyber Kill Chain plays an important role in helping
									organizations
									define their cybersecurity strategy. As part of this model, organizations must adopt
									services and
									solutions that allow them to:<br>
									• Detect attackers within each stage of the threat lifecycle with threat
									intelligence techniques<br>
									• Prevent access from unauthorized users<br>
									• Stop sensitive data from being shared, saved, altered, exfiltrated or encrypted by
									unauthorized
									users<br>
									• Respond to attacks in real-time<br>
									• Stop lateral movement of an attacker within the network</p>
