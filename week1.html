								<p>
									Cybersecurity, also known as digital security, is the practice of protecting your
									digital information, devices, and assets.
									This includes your personal information, accounts, files, photos and even money.
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>

								<p>
									<b>CIA</b><br>
									The acronym "CIA" is often used to represent the three pillars of
									cybersecurity.<br><br>
								</p>

								<center><img height="300" width="300" src="images/cia.png"></center><br><br>

								<p><b>Privacy</b> - Keeping your secrets and ensuring that only authorized people can
									access
									your files and
									accounts.<br><br>

									<b>Integrity</b> - Ensuring that your information is as it should be and that no one
									adds, changes or deletes anything without your permission. For example, maliciously
									changing numbers
									in a spreadsheet.<br><br>

									<b>Access</b> - To provide you with access to your information and systems when you
									need
									them. An example
									of an access problem is a denial of service attack, where attackers flood your
									system with network
									traffic to make it nearly impossible to access; or ransomware that encrypts your
									system and prevents
									you from using it.

									<b>Security is a process, not a product!</b><br>
									While security apps and devices like anti-malware software and firewalls are
									necessary, it's not
									enough to just plug these tools in and call them good. Digital security also
									requires the
									implementation of a set of thoughtful processes and practices.

									These include:<br><br>
									<b>Data backups</b> - Important data should be stored in a safe place and you should
									be
									able to restore a
									good, tested copy of that data in case something bad happens to the file.<br><br>

									<b>Good cyber habits</b> - Do not open unexpected links or attachments that you may
									receive
									in email or
									text, even if they appear to be from a trusted sender.<br><br>

									<b>Keeping your software up-to-date</b> – Operating systems like Windows, MacOS, iOS
									or
									Android, as well as
									apps and browsers should be kept up to date with the latest patches and fixes from
									the manufacturer.<br><br>

									<b>Use strong, unique, and passwords</b> - Good passwords should be at least 14
									characters
									long, have
									English words, and should not be reused across multiple accounts.<br><br>

									<b>Use Multi-Factor Authentication</b> - Whenever possible, enable multi-factor
									authentication to keep your
									accounts more secure, both at home and at work.<br><br>

									<b>Lock your devices</b> - Make sure your devices require a password, PIN, or
									biometric
									authentication such
									as fingerprint or facial recognition to log in. Lost or stolen devices can be a
									goldmine for
									criminals if they can easily access data from an unlocked device.

									<b>What are the types of attacks that cybersecurity attempts to defend?</b><br><br>
									Cybersecurity professionals strive to contain and mitigate existing and new threats
									that
									infiltrate computer systems in different ways. We give some examples of common cyber
									threats
									below.<br>
									<b>Malware:</b><br>
									Malware stands for malicious software. It includes a range of software programs
									built to allow
									third parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to interrupt
									the normal
									working of a critical infrastructure. Common examples of malware include Trojans,
									spyware, and
									viruses.<br>
									<b>Ransomware:</b><br>
									Ransomware refers to a business model and a wide range of associated technologies
									that bad
									actors use to extort money from entities. Whether you’re just getting started or
									already
									building on AWS, we have resources dedicated to help you protect your critical
									systems and
									sensitive data against ransomware.<br>
									<b>Man-in-the-middle attack:</b><br>
									A man-in-the-middle attack involves an outside party attempting unauthorized access
									over a
									network during a data exchange. Such attacks increase the security risks of
									sensitive
									information such as financial data.<br>
									<b>Phishing:</b><br>
									Phishing is a cyber threat that uses social engineering techniques to trick users
									into revealing
									personally identifiable information. For example, cyber attackers send emails that
									result in
									users clicking and entering credit card data on a fake payment webpage. Phishing
									attacks can
									also result in the downloading of malicious attachments which install malware on
									company
									devices.<br>

									<b>DDoS:</b><br>
									A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is a coordinated effort to overwhelm a
									server by
									sending a high volume of fake requests. Such events prevent normal users from
									connecting or
									accessing the targeted server.<br>

									<b>Insider threat:</b><br>
									An insider threat is a security risk introduced by personnel with ill intentions
									within an
									organization. The personnel possess high-level access to the computer systems and
									could
									destabilize the infrastructure's security from within.

									<b>The Top Skills Required for Cybersecurity Jobs</b><br><br>
									<b>Problem-Solving Skills:</b><br>
									As a cybersecurity professional, problem-solving will play a major role in your
									day-to-day work.
									Those in the field need to find creative ways to take on and address complex
									information
									security challenges across a variety of existing and emerging technologies and
									digital
									environments.<br><br>
									<b>Technical Aptitude:</b><br>
									As the name implies, cybersecurity is a technology-focused field: you will be likely
									be tasked
									with responsibilities such as troubleshooting, maintaining, and updating information
									security
									systems; implementing continuous network monitoring; and providing real-time
									security solutions.
									Being technologically savvy is essential in order to perform the daily activities of
									a
									cybersecurity professional.<br><br>
									<b>Knowledge of Security Across Various Platforms:</b><br>
									Cybersecurity isn't just limited to computers: you'll need to be comfortable working
									on a
									variety of operating systems, computer systems, mobile devices, cloud networks, and
									wireless
									networks - and keep up to date on advances in the field for all of them.<br><br>
									<b>Attention to Detail:</b><br>
									Being able to defend an organization against cyber breaches requires you to be
									highly vigilant
									and detail-oriented, in order to effectively detect vulnerabilities and risks.
									You'll like be
									responsible for continuous network monitoring and will need to be able to quickly
									identify
									concerns and come up with real-time security solutions to address them.<br><br>
									<b>Communication Skills:</b><br>
									As a cybersecurity specialist, you'll be working closely with individuals in other
									roles and
									departments, and it's important to be able to effectively communicate and explain
									your findings,
									concerns, and solutions to others. It's important to be able to speak clearly and
									concisely on
									cybersecurity strategy and policy, as well as to be able to convey technical
									information to
									individuals of different levels of technical comprehension.<br><br>
									<b>Fundamental Computer Forensics Skills:</b><br>
									While computer forensics and cybersecurity are two separate fields, they're closely
									related -
									and having a foundation in computer forensics can help you excel in your
									cybersecurity career.
									To be able to effectively protect organizations' digital assets and prevent security
									breaches,
									you'll need to have a solid understanding of what happens if your efforts fail, and
									how
									compromised data is recovered. Most cybersecurity degree programs will have a
									computer forensics
									component for this reason.<br><br>
									<b>A Desire to Learn:</b><br>
									As with any technical field, cybersecurity is fast-changing. Anyone who works in the
									field will
									need to be committed to keeping current with best practices and emerging industry
									trends, and
									will always need to be learning and self-educating - both on and off the
									clock.<br><br>
									<b>An Understanding of Hacking:</b><br>
									To effectively protect an organization's network and infrastructure, you'll need to
									know how
									they can be exploited in the first place - that's why most cybersecurity
									professionals must
									learn how to "ethically hack." Essentially, you need to have the same skills as a
									hacker, to
									fully understand how a system could be breached, and in turn, create effective
									solutions for
									thwarting these attacks.
