								<p><b>What is SolarWinds?</b></p><br>
								<p>SolarWinds is a major software company based in Tulsa, Okla., which provides system
									management tools
									for network and infrastructure monitoring, and other technical services to hundreds
									of thousands of
									organizations around the world. Among the company's products is an IT performance
									monitoring system
									called Orion.
									<br>As an IT monitoring system, SolarWinds Orion has privileged access to IT systems
									to
									obtain log and
									system performance data. It is that privileged position and its wide deployment that
									made SolarWinds
									a lucrative and attractive target.

								<p><b>What was the purpose of the hack?</b></p><br>
								<p>The purpose of the hack remains largely unknown. Still, there are many reasons
									hackers would want to
									get into an organization's system, including having access to future product plans
									or employee and
									customer information held for ransom. It is also not yet clear what information, if
									any, hackers
									stole from government agencies. But the level of access appears to be deep and
									broad.
									<br>There are speculations that many enterprises might be collateral damage, as the
									main
									focus of the
									attack was government agencies that make use of the SolarWinds IT management
									systems.

								<p><b>Who was responsible for the hack?</b></p><br>
								<p>Federal investigators and cybersecurity agents believe a Russian espionage operation
									-- mostly
									likely Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service -- is behind the SolarWinds attack.
									<br>The Russian government has denied any involvement in the attack, releasing a
									statement that said,
									"Malicious activities in the information space contradicts the principles of the
									Russian foreign
									policy, national interests and understanding of interstate relations." They also
									added that "Russia
									does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain."

								<p><b>Why is the SolarWinds hack important?</b></p><br>
								<p>The SolarWinds supply chain attack is a global hack, as threat actors turned the
									Orion software into
									a weapon gaining access to several government systems and thousands of private
									systems around the
									world. Due to the nature of the software -- and by extension the Sunburst malware --
									having access
									to entire networks, many government and enterprise networks and systems face the
									risk of significant
									breaches.
									<br>The hack could also be the catalyst for rapid, broad change in the cybersecurity
									industry. Many
									companies and government agencies are now in the process of devising new methods to
									react to these
									types of attacks before they happen. Governments and organizations are learning that
									it is not
									enough to build a firewall and hope it protects them. They have to actively seek out
									vulnerabilities
									in their systems, and either shore them up or turn them into traps against these
									types of attacks.
									<br>Since the hack was discovered, SolarWinds has recommended customers update their
									existing Orion
									platform. The company has released patches for the malware and other potential
									vulnerabilities
									discovered since the initial Orion attack. SolarWinds also recommended customers not
									able to update
									Orion isolate SolarWinds servers and/or change passwords for accounts that have
									access to those
									servers.
									<br>The greater White House cybersecurity focus will be crucial, some industry
									experts
									have said. But
									organizations should consider adopting modern software-as-a-service tools for
									monitoring and
									collaboration. While the cybersecurity industry has significantly advanced in the
									last decade, these
									kinds of attacks show that there is still a long way to go to get really secure
									systems.

								<p><b>What is the SolarWinds hack?</b></p><br>
								<p>The SolarWinds hack is the commonly used term to refer to the supply chain breach
									that involved the
									SolarWinds Orion system.
									<br>In this hack, suspected nation-state hackers that have been identified as a
									group
									known as Nobelium
									by Microsoft -- and often simply referred to as the SolarWinds Hackers by other
									researchers --
									gained access to the networks, systems and data of thousands of SolarWinds
									customers. The breadth of
									the hack is unprecedented and one of the largest, if not the largest, of its kind
									ever recorded.
									<br>More than 30,000 public and private organizations -- including local, state and
									federal agencies --
									use the Orion network management system to manage their IT resources. As a result,
									the hack
									compromised the data, networks and systems of thousands when SolarWinds
									inadvertently delivered the
									backdoor malware as an update to the Orion software.
									<br>SolarWinds customers weren't the only ones affected. Because the hack exposed
									the
									inner workings of
									Orion users, the hackers could potentially gain access to the data and networks of
									their customers
									and partners as well -- enabling affected victims to grow exponentially from there.

						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>How did the SolarWinds hack happen?</b></p><br>
								<p>The hackers used a method known as a supply chain attack to insert malicious code
									into the Orion
									system. A supply chain attack works by targeting a third party with access to an
									organization's
									systems rather than trying to hack the networks directly.
									<br>The third-party software, in this case the SolarWinds Orion Platform, creates a
									backdoor through
									which hackers can access and impersonate users and accounts of victim organizations.
									The malware
									could also access system files and blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity
									without detection,
									even by antivirus software.
									<br>SolarWinds was a perfect target for this kind of supply chain attack. Because
									their
									Orion software
									is used by many multinational companies and government agencies, all the hackers had
									to do was
									install the malicious code into a new batch of software distributed by SolarWinds as
									an update or
									patch.

								<p><b>What is Kali Linux?</b></p><br>
								<p>Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution that is designed for digital
									forensics and penetration testing. It is funded and maintained by Offensive
									Security, an information training company. Kali Linux was developed through the
									rewrite of BackTrack by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns of Offensive Security. Kali
									Linux comes with a large number of tools that are well suited to a variety of
									information security tasks, including penetration testing, computer forensics,
									security research, and reverse engineering.
									<br>BackTrack was their previous information security operating system. Kali Linux's
									first version, Kali 1.0.0, was released in March 2013. Kali Linux is now funded and
									supported by Offensive Security. Today, if we went to Kali's website (www.kali.org),
									we'd notice a giant banner that states, "Our Most Advanced Penetration Testing
									Distribution, Ever." A very bold statement that ironically has yet to be disproven.
									There are over 600 penetration-testing applications preconfigured on Kali Linux for
									us to explore. Each program has its own set of capabilities and applications. Kali
									Linux performs a fantastic job of categorizing these important tools into the
									following groups:<br>
									1. Information Gathering
									<br>2. Vulnerability Analysis
									<br>3. Wireless Attacks
									<br>4. Web Application
									<br>5. Exploitation Tools
									<br>6. Stress Testing
									<br>7. Forensics Tools

								<p><b>What is Virtualization?</b></p><br>
								<p>‘Virtualization’ means to make a virtual representation of something. You can make a
									virtual representation of an application, server, storage, or network. You can also
									virtualize memory, storage, or data.
									<br>A virtual machine (VM) is an independent software container. Each VM runs an
									operating system and an application. You can put multiple VMs on the same computer
									(host). One computer can host several different operating systems and applications.
									<br>A hypervisor is a layer of software connecting the virtual machines to the host
									computer. It allocates the computer’s resources to the different VMs as needed. It
									is what allows many VMs to run on the same physical computer.
									<br>The hypervisor also protects the VMs from each other. If one VM crashes or is
									infected with malware it won’t affect the other VMs operating on that same host. It
									is important to continuously backup your system and have a data recovery service,
									even when you’re using VMware.
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Why You Should Use Virtualization?</b></p><br>
								<p>Virtualization is an effective way to reduce costs and increase your IT efficiency
									and scalability. It enables faster disaster recovery and almost eliminates downtime.
									At the same time, it reduces your capital and operating costs.
									<br>Usually, only one operating system can be on one physical machine. So, to test
									multiple operating systems you would need multiple physical computers.
									<br>Virtualization lets you run many operating systems and applications on one
									single
									server. With VMs you can try new operating systems, test computer viruses, and visit
									unknown/untrustworthy websites.
									<br>You can easily create copies of VMs and revert back to previous versions
									whenever
									you wish.
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Types of Virtualization</b></p><br>
								<p>There are three main types of virtualization: <b>Server, Network, and Desktop.</b>
									<br>Server virtualization allows you to run multiple operating systems on one
									physical
									server. Your server doesn’t need to be as complex or sprawled out. This increases
									your application performance and reduces operating costs as well as allowing you to
									deploy your workload faster.
									<br>Network virtualization runs applications on a virtual network the same as if it
									was
									on a physical network. Your hardware remains independent and your network operates
									at a higher capacity.
									<br>Desktop virtualization is useful with branch offices and remote employees. It
									allows
									IT companies to respond quickly to workplace needs and new opportunities that emerge
									in the marketplace. Remote employees can access company software from their own
									computers.
								</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>What is VMware?</b></p><br>
								<p>virtualization software. They produce virtualization, networking, and security
									management tools.
									<br>VMware software allows you to run a virtual computer on your physical computer.
									It
									increases the efficiency of your computer system. You can use more applications with
									fewer physical computers.
									<br>Enterprises often use VMware in conjunction with Cloud Computing. VMware creates
									a
									computer environment that is independent of a physical structure. With Cloud
									Computing you can share software or data across your network via the Internet.
									<br>Virtualization servers and cloud computing services offer greater agility and
									self-sufficiency. Together they increase your IT department’s productivity and
									security.

									<br>Before you install a VM, confirm that your processor supports virtualization.
									Decide
									what applications you are going to run on it and check their compatibility with your
									OS.
