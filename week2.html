								<p>Verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control
									Message Protocol (ICMP) echo Request messages. The receipt of corresponding echo

									messages are displayed, along with round-trip times. ping is the primary TCP/IP
									command
									used to troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution. Used without
									parameters, this command displays Help content.
									You can also use this command to test both the computer name and the IP address of
									the
									computer. If pinging the IP address is successful, but pinging the computer name
									isn't,
									you might have a name resolution problem. In this case, make sure the computer name
									you
									are specifying can be resolved through the local Hosts file, by using Domain Name
									System
									(DNS) queries, or through NetBIOS name resolution techniques.
									This command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is installed as a
									component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections.</p>

							<h3>tracert</h3><br><br>
							<p> This diagnostic tool determines the path taken to a destination by sending Internet
								Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo Request or ICMPv6 messages to the destination with
								incrementally increasing time to live (TTL) field values. Each router along the path is
								required to decrement the TTL in an IP packet by at least 1 before forwarding it.
								Effectively, the TTL is a maximum link counter. When the TTL on a packet reaches 0, the
								router is expected to return an ICMP time Exceeded message to the source computer.<br>
								<br>This command determines the path by sending the first echo Request message with a
								TTL of
								1 and incrementing the TTL by 1 on each subsequent transmission until the target
								responds or the maximum number of hops is reached. The maximum number of hops is 30 by
								default and can be specified using the /h parameter.<br>
								<br>The path is determined by examining the ICMP time Exceeded messages returned by
								intermediate routers and the echo Reply message returned by the destination. However,
								some routers do not return time Exceeded messages for packets with expired TTL values
								and are invisible to the tracert command. In this case, a row of asterisks (*) is
								displayed for that hop. The path displayed is the list of near/side router interfaces of
								the routers in the path between a source host and a destination. The near/side interface
								is the interface of the router that is closest to the sending host in the path.<br>
								<b>Important:</b><br>
								This command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol is installed
								as a component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections.
								To trace a path and provide network latency and packet loss for each router and link in
								the path, use the pathping command command.

										The effects of the ping value are not only visible in online games. Watching
										movies and videos, making a video call, or visiting a website are also linked to
										ping.

										<br>The ping value is measured in milliseconds (ms). The ideal ping value is 50
										ms
										or less. Values above 150 ms cause serious problems in internet connection. If
										the ping value is high in the speed test, it means the connection speed quality
										is low. There are also issues to be considered in the speed test. Here are tips
										for getting accurate results in any area or home internet speed test:
										<br>1. It is necessary to close all browsers that are open on the computer.
										<br>2. It is recommended that only the site to be speed tested should remain as
										the
										open site.
										<br>3. Turning off Wi-Fi is very effective for the right result.
										<br>4. It is important to disconnect all devices connected to the Internet
										network.
										<br>5. It is specifically stated that all applications that consume the Internet
										should be closed.
										<br>There are factors that affect the ping value for a quality internet usage
										and
										efficient gaming environment. Internet infrastructure, internet speed and modem
										quality evaluation make a big difference for the ping value.
