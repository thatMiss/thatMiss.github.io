								<p><b>What is a DDoS Attack? - DDoS Meaning</b></p><br>
								<p>Distributed Network Attacks are often referred to as Distributed Denial of Service
									(DDoS) attacks. This type of attack takes advantage of the specific capacity limits
									that apply to any network resources – such as the infrastructure that enables a
									company’s website. The DDoS attack will send multiple requests to the attacked web
									resource – with the aim of exceeding the website’s capacity to handle multiple
									requests… and prevent the website from functioning correctly.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>How a DDoS attack works?</b></p><br>
								<p>Network resources – such as web servers – have a finite limit to the number of
									requests that they can service simultaneously. In addition to the capacity limit of
									the server, the channel that connects the server to the Internet will also have a
									finite bandwidth / capacity. Whenever the number of requests exceeds the capacity
									limits of any component of the infrastructure, the level of service is likely to
									suffer in one of the following ways:
									<br>• The response to requests will be much slower than normal.
									<br>• Some – or all – users’ requests may be totally ignored.
									<br>Usually, the attacker’s ultimate aim is the total prevention of the web
									resource’s normal functioning – a total ‘denial of service’. The attacker may also
									request payment for stopping the attack. In some cases, a DDoS attack may even be an
									attempt to discredit or damage a competitor’s business.
								</p>

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Using a Botnet ‘zombie network’ to deliver a DDoS attack</b></p><br>
								<p>In order to send an extremely large number of requests to the victim resource, the
									cybercriminal will often establish a ‘zombie network’ of computers that the criminal
									has infected. Because the criminal has control over the actions of every infected
									computer in the zombie network, the sheer scale of the attack can be overwhelming
									for the victim’s web resources.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>The nature of today’s DDoS threats</b></p><br>
								<p>In the early to mid-2000s, this kind of criminal activity was quite common. However,
									the number of successful DDoS attacks has been reducing. This decrease in DDoS
									attacks is likely to have resulted from the following:
									<br>• Police investigations that have resulted in the arrest of criminals across the
									world
									<br>• Technical countermeasures that have been successful against DDoS attacks
								</p>

								<p><b>What is a Honeypot?</b></p><br>
								<p>A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a virtual trap to lure attackers. An
									intentionally compromised computer system allows attackers to exploit
									vulnerabilities so you can study them to improve your security policies. You can
									apply a honeypot to any computing resource from software and networks to file
									servers and routers.
									<br>Honeypots are a type of deception technology that allows you to understand
									attacker
									behavior patterns. Security teams can use honeypots to investigate cybersecurity
									breaches to collect intel on how cybercriminals operate. They also reduce the risk
									of false positives, when compared to traditional cybersecurity measures, because
									they are unlikely to attract legitimate activity.
									<br>Honeypots vary based on design and deployment models, but they are all decoys
									intended to look like legitimate, vulnerable systems to attract cybercriminals.
								</p>

						<tr>
							<td>
								<p><b>Honeynet: A Network of Honeypots</b></p><br>
								<p>A honeynet is a decoy network that contains one or more honeypots. It looks like a
									real network and contains multiple systems but is hosted on one or only a few
									servers, each representing one environment. For example, a Windows honeypot machine,
									a Mac honeypot machine and a Linux honeypot machine.
									<br>A “honeywall” monitors the traffic going in and out of the network and directs
									it to
									the honeypot instances. You can inject vulnerabilities into a honeynet to make it
									easy for an attacker to access the trap.
								</p>
								<img height="400" width="500" src="images/hp.png">
								<p>Example of a honeynet topology<br>
									Any system on the honeynet may serve as a point of entry for attackers. The honeynet
									gathers intelligence on the attackers and diverts them from the real network. The
									advantage of a honeynet over a simple honeypot is that it feels more like a real
									network, and has a larger catchment area.
									<br>This makes honeynet a better solution for large, complex networks – it presents
									attackers with an alternative corporate network which can represent an attractive
									alternative to the real one.

							<td>
								<p><b>What is port security?</b></p><br>
								<p>Port Security helps secure the network by preventing unknown devices from forwarding
									packets. When a link goes down, all dynamically locked addresses are freed. The port
									security feature offers the following benefits:
									<br>• You can limit the number of MAC addresses on a given port. Packets that have a
									matching MAC address (secure packets) are forwarded; all other packets (unsecure
									packets) are restricted.
									<br>• You can enable port security on a per port basis.
									Port security implements two traffic filtering methods, dynamic locking and static
									locking. These methods can be used concurrently.
									<br>• <b>Dynamic locking:</b> You can specify the maximum number of MAC addresses
									that can be
									learned on a port. The maximum number of MAC addresses is platform dependent and is
									given in the software Release Notes. After the limit is reached, additional MAC
									addresses are not learned. Only frames with an allowable source MAC addresses are
									forwarded.

									<br><b>Note:</b> If you want to set a specific MAC address for a port, set the
									dynamic entries
									to 0, then allow only packets with a MAC address matching the MAC address in the
									static list.

									<br>Dynamically locked addresses can be converted to statically locked addresses.
									Dynamically locked MAC addresses are aged out if another packet with that address is
									not seen within the age-out time. You can set the time out value. Dynamically locked
									MAC addresses are eligible to be learned by another port. Static MAC addresses are
									not eligible for aging.

									<br>• <b>Static locking:</b> You can manually specify a list of static MAC addresses
									for a
									port. Dynamically locked addresses can be converted to statically locked addresses.

										As we will understand above, the target server, which is exposed to a data
										traffic higher than its normal traffic as a result of DDOS attack, cannot handle
										this load and becomes inoperable. In other words, as a result of the attack, the
										service provided by the target server is disrupted and customers are blocked
										from accessing the website.
										<br>And, if this technique is deliberately put into practice:
										<br>“244/1 of the TCK No. 5237. Pursuant to the article “Anyone who hinders or
										disrupts the functioning of an information system is punished with imprisonment
										from one year to five years.” In that case, since DDoS attacks correspond to the
										act of "preventing the operation of an information system", they give rise to
										the crime envisaged in TCK m244.”
