								<p><b>What is MITM Attack?</b></p><br>
								<p>A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions
									himself in a conversation between a user and an application—either to eavesdrop or
									to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of
									information is underway.
									<br>The goal of an attack is to steal personal information, such as login
									credentials,
									account details and credit card numbers. Targets are typically the users of
									financial applications, SaaS businesses, e-commerce sites and other websites where
									logging in is required.
									<br>Information obtained during an attack could be used for many purposes, including
									identity theft, unapproved fund transfers or an illicit password change.
									<br>Additionally, it can be used to gain a foothold inside a secured perimeter
									during
									the infiltration stage of an advanced persistent threat (APT) assault.
									<br>Broadly speaking, a MITM attack is the equivalent of a mailman opening your bank
									statement, writing down your account details and then resealing the envelope and
									delivering it to your door.

								<p><b>MITM attack progression</b></p><br>
								<p>Successful MITM execution has two distinct phases: interception and decryption.
									<br><b>Interception</b><br>
									The first step intercepts user traffic through the attacker’s network before it
									reaches its intended destination.
									<br>The most common (and simplest) way of doing this is a passive attack in which an
									attacker makes free, malicious WiFi hotspots available to the public. Typically
									named in a way that corresponds to their location, they aren’t password protected.
									Once a victim connects to such a hotspot, the attacker gains full visibility to any
									online data exchange.
									<br>Attackers wishing to take a more active approach to interception may launch one
									of
									the following attacks:
									<br>• <b>IP spoofing</b> involves an attacker disguising himself as an application
									by altering
									packet headers in an IP address. As a result, users attempting to access a URL
									connected to the application are sent to the attacker’s website.
									<br>• <b>ARP spoofing</b> is the process of linking an attacker’s MAC address with
									the IP
									address of a legitimate user on a local area network using fake ARP messages. As a
									result, data sent by the user to the host IP address is instead transmitted to the
									attacker.
									<br>• <b>DNS spoofing</b>, also known as DNS cache poisoning, involves infiltrating
									a DNS
									server and altering a website’s address record. As a result, users attempting to
									access the site are sent by the altered DNS record to the attacker’s site.
									<br><b>Decryption</b><br>
									After interception, any two-way SSL traffic needs to be decrypted without alerting
									the user or application. A number of methods exist to achieve this:
									<br>• <b>HTTPS spoofing</b> sends a phony certificate to the victim’s browser once
									the initial
									connection request to a secure site is made. It holds a digital thumbprint
									associated with the compromised application, which the browser verifies according to
									an existing list of trusted sites. The attacker is then able to access any data
									entered by the victim before it’s passed to the application.
									<br>• <b>SSL BEAST</b> (browser exploit against SSL/TLS) targets a TLS version 1.0
									vulnerability in SSL. Here, the victim’s computer is infected with malicious
									JavaScript that intercepts encrypted cookies sent by a web application. Then the
									app’s cipher block chaining (CBC) is compromised so as to decrypt its cookies and
									authentication tokens.
									<br>• <b>SSL hijacking</b> occurs when an attacker passes forged authentication keys
									to both
									the user and application during a TCP handshake. This sets up what appears to be a
									secure connection when, in fact, the man in the middle controls the entire session.
									<br>• <b>SSL stripping</b> downgrades a HTTPS connection to HTTP by intercepting the
									TLS
									authentication sent from the application to the user. The attacker sends an
									unencrypted version of the application’s site to the user while maintaining the
									secured session with the application. Meanwhile, the user’s entire session is
									visible to the attacker.

								<p><b>Man in the middle attack prevention</b></p><br>
								<p>Blocking MITM attacks requires several practical steps on the part of users, as well
									as a combination of encryption and verification methods for applications.
									<br>For users, this means:
									<br>• Avoiding WiFi connections that aren’t password protected.
									<br>• Paying attention to browser notifications reporting a website as being
									unsecured.
									<br>• Immediately logging out of a secure application when it’s not in use.
									<br>• Not using public networks (e.g., coffee shops, hotels) when conducting
									sensitive
									transactions.
									<br>For website operators, secure communication protocols, including TLS and HTTPS,
									help
									mitigate spoofing attacks by robustly encrypting and authenticating transmitted
									data. Doing so prevents the interception of site traffic and blocks the decryption
									of sensitive data, such as authentication tokens.
									<br>It is considered best practice for applications to use SSL/TLS to secure every
									page
									of their site and not just the pages that require users to log in. Doing so helps
									decreases the chance of an attacker stealing session cookies from a user browsing on
									an unsecured section of a website while logged in.

										<br>With the increase in globalization from the past to the present, the
										developments in the field of information and technology, as well as the
										integration of digitalization into our lives, have led to the occurrence of many
										cyber-attacks within the computer.

										<br>Cyber Attack is defined as the attacks made by professional hackers or hacker
										groups on corporate or individual websites, networks or computers with the aim
										of gaining and harming computers and the internet. (Yıldırım, 2018)

										<br>In this context, in order to be protected from cyber-attacks, we must be
										conscious of both cyber-attacks against users and cyber-attacks against
										computers in the context of cyber security.

										<br>Here you might think that cyber-attacks against users and cyber-attacks on
										computers are the same; However, while cyber-attacks against computers are
										carried out by finding a flaw in the system, cyber-attacks against users are
										defined as using the person's internet usage habits and determining a strategy
										and deceiving that person/people.

										<br>According to Avcı, many systems are in danger due to the increasing number of
										cyber-attacks and unconscious internet use. These experienced and potential
										cyber threats lead experts trying to protect systems to conduct various
										researches on these issues. (Avcı, Özarpa, Yıldırım, Kınacı, Yıldırım, & Koca,
										2021)

										<br>In this context, in order not to be under cyber threat, we must continue to live
										more securely in cyberspace by learning what cyber-attacks are and how some of
										them are carried out. In this context, in order not to be under cyber threat, we
										must continue to live more securely in cyberspace by learning what cyber-attacks
